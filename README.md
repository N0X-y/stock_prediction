# Impact of Sentiment Analysis on Financial Price Prediction: Comparison between LSTM, BERT and FinBERT.

In the current economic context, an increasing number of people are becoming interested in the world of investments, driven by easier access to digital platforms and the growing globalization of markets. This phenomenon involves not only large funds, but also small investors seeking to make their capital profitable in the face of economic uncertainty, inflation and low interest rates. This trend has generated a growing demand for tools that allow faster, more accurate and better-informed financial decisions.

In this regard, this paper aims to analyze the impact of sentiment analysis on financial price prediction, integrating historical market data with textual information extracted from economic news. For this purpose, three different approaches are compared: (1) an LSTM model based exclusively on historical price time series; (2) an LSTM model combined with sentiment vectors generated using BERT; and (3) an LSTM model integrating sentiment analysis produced by FinBERT, a variant of BERT trained specifically in the financial domain.

Data collection is performed using Yahoo Finance (for historical prices) and Finnhub (for financial news) APIs. The texts are processed using sentiment analysis techniques with the BERT and FinBERT language models. The results obtained are incorporated as input variables into the LSTM model along with the historical data. Finally, quantitative metrics are applied to evaluate the accuracy of each approach and determine which one offers better results in predicting market movements.
